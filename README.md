Project Overview
The basic premise of the project is to create a program that would take written sentences and inflate them with doublespeak to stretch out the length. What I created was a proof of concept that takes a simple “The__is__.” sentence and inserts a random selection of inflated language to make the sentence longer than it needs to be. I imagine a complete, realized program could take entire paragraphs and choose words and phrases from databases to create puffed-up language.

While the tutorials about the random text generators in Python were very helpful, I initially had some trouble finding Python 3 equivalents of the examples given in the videos. For Milestone 1 struggled with getting code written and could not figure out how to make a function that could pick randomly from a list in Python 3, but then I learned about the random.choice() function which made choosing from the lists of phrases and constructing the sentences. Then after Milestone 2 it was just a matter of testing different combinations to make sure that the language would be consistently coherent.

Corrections
Though I can not point to anything specific, I can say you comments did help improve my project.
